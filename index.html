      <p> I have had little programming experience before bootcamp. I have good experience with networking and security; the last piece of the puzzle would be programming as it will give me the full experience of computational interaction.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Running Man
	  2D Game 2022: Devil May Cry</h3>
    <p> My bootcamp project consists of stickmen. The main stickman is what the player will play as. The aim of the game is to simply jump over the stickmen known as "Killers". If the player hits the "killer" then the game will end and will display the message "Game Over." There is no end to this game, it will go on forever until the "killer" hits the player. The requirement to play the game is just the spacebar.
	    My 2D Java game project consists of a Hunter and mutliple enemies. The player will control the Hunter and will have to shoot enemies to kill them. When they approach the portal, they will proceed to the next level. Once they finish Level 3, the game will close.
